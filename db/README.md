# DATABASE

In order for the Server/backend to function correctly, you need to setup a MySQL Database. This document only covers MySQL Server setup, you should refer to [server setup documentation](../server/README.md#configure) for configuring your backend with the database.

## Setup with Docker (Recommended)

Assuming you are in `db/` directory

Run following command to build database docker image
* **Note: you MUST supply --build-arg so docker can setup the root password of database**
* **You should replace the password with something more secure**

```sh
docker build -t yourmoon-db . --build-arg="ROOT_PASSWORD=root"
```

Now, you can launch the database with following command

```sh
docker run -d --rm --name yourmoon-db -p 3306:3306 yourmoon-db
```

## Other Setup methods

First, you need to install MySQL Server on your machine

* Windows
  * [article](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/install-mysql-windows/)
  * [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2om3byn2lxs)
* MacOS
  * [article](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/macos-installation.html)
  * [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cvH0HRjZF8)
* Ubuntu/Debian Linux
  * [article](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mysql-on-ubuntu-22-04)
  * [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRfI79BHf3k)
* Setup using XAMPP, a popular PHP development environment that will also setup MySQL Server for you
  * Available on Windows, MacOS, and Linux
  * [download](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)

After you install MySQL Server on your machine, you should have a root account at this point.

Now, you can connect to your database via a MySQL Client like
* [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/)
* [MySQL Shell](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/)
  * You might have this software while installing MySQL Server
* Or other MySQL Client

Then, you need to initialize database and tables, just copy the content of [Your Moon Database.sql](./Your%20Moon%20Database.sql) and paste in your MySQL Client

This sql file will create a database `YourMoonDB` with all the tables we need.

## After Database Setup

At this point, you already can use the database with the root account. However, it is a bad idea to deploy your app using database root account. So we recommend you to setup an user account for this application.

Go to file [Init User.sql](./Init%20User.sql). This file contains all the commands you need for creating an user called `yourmoonapp` who only have the necessary privileges for this app.

You need to modify the password by changing this line:

```sql
CREATE USER 'yourmoonapp'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
```

Just replace `password` with something more secure.

Then, you can copy the modified command to your MySQL Client and execute them with root account.

**Optional Step**

* you can ask MySQL Server to only allow this user connecting from specific IP by:
  * replace all the character `%` in the file with your desire IP
* This step will add an extra layer of protection to your database. You can only allow the connection coming from specific remote server

Refer to [server setup documentation](../server/README.md#configure) for configuring your backend with the database.
