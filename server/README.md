# Your-Moon Backend server

## Configure

1. in folder `src/server/config`, create a new file called `dev.config.json`
   * you can have 2 different configuration files for dev and production environment
   * If environment variable `NODE_ENV` is set to `production`
     * server will looking for file `production.config.json`
   * Else
     * server will looking for file `dev.config.json`
   * This tutorial will use `dev.config.json` as example
2. add following configuration in it

```jsonc
{
    "app_host": "localhost",
    "app_port": 3001,
    "max_upload_size": 31457280, // 30MB
    "log_file": "/path/to/your-moon-server.log",
    "log_level": "debug",
    "aes_key": "Base64_aes_key_256_bits_for_email_encryption",
    "jwt_secret": "Base64_jwt_secret_with_HS256_algorithm_512_bits",
    "cors_origin_whitelist": [
        "http://localhost:5173"
    ],
    "db": {
        "host": "localhost",
        "port": 3306,
        "user": "username",
        "password": "password",
        "database": "YourMoonDB"
    },
    "aws": {
        "accessKeyId": "SUPER/SECRET?KEY1",
        "secretAccessKey": "THIS@KEY%IS*EVEN%MORE$SECRET",
        "region": "us-west-2",
        "bucket_name": "my-bucket-name"
    },
    "oauth":{
        "github":{
            "clientId":"somesecretid",
            "clientSecret":"somesecretsecret"
        },
        "google":{
            "clientId":"somesecretid",
            "clientSecret":"somesecretsecret"
        }
    }
}
```

* Note that both `aes_key` and `jwt_secret` are saved as base64 encoded strings. To create them, you can run following python script in any python 3.x environment. (I suggest [this website](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/) for anyone don't want to install python)

```py
from random import randbytes
from base64 import b64encode
print(b64encode(randbytes(int(int(input('How many bits: '))/8))).decode('utf-8'))
```

* Note that `cors_origin_whitelist` is a list of urls to the the frontend, they are whitelist for cors cross origin protection. This is because we need to send credentials (cookie) from the frontend to backend.

3. you can use `.template` files under `src/server/config/` as your starting point


## Deploy

### Deploy with Docker (Recommended)

Assuming you are in folder `src/server`

run following command to deploy with docker

1. build the docker image

```sh
docker build -t your-moon-server .
```

2. then, run docker container with following command

```sh
docker run -it --rm --name your-moon-server -p 3001:3001 -v "$(pwd)/config:/src/config" -v "$(pwd)/uploadedImages:/src/uploadedImages" your-moon-server
```

### Deploy manually

1. install all dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

2. run the server with

```sh
node index.js
```

3. you can also deploy the server for development

```sh
npm run devStart
```

* **Note that you can tell the server to switch configuration file by setting environment variable**
  * Server will use `dev.config.json` if environment variable `NODE_ENV != "production"`
  * Server will use `production.config.json` if environment variable `NODE_ENV == "production"`

## Running Backend

Backend is running on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) by default

All endpoints in backend are start with `/api/`
